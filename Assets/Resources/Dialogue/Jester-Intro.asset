    - "Oh haha. You might find this place a bit\u2026 barren.."
    - But worry not! I am here to help you fill it with life, colors, and memories.

      in two types:'

      down, '
    - and others will act as <tools> to guide you along the way.

    - Sticker? But I don't have any...
  - speaker: THE JESTER
    lines:
    - Oh! I lost the ordinary stickers all around this place, you may need to find
      them to rebuild the scene,
    - "Here, William, take these. They\u2019re tools to help you along the way."
