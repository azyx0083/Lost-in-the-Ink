    - Hello? Are you ok?
  - speaker: THE CHILD
    lines:
    - "I\u2019ve been waiting for them for quite some time now. Did they just forget
      about me or something?"
  - speaker: Wiliam
    lines:
    - "Who are you waiting for? I\u2019m sure they haven\u2019t forgotten about you. "
  - speaker: THE CHILD
    lines:
    - You wouldn't know them. My two friends. Mia and Leo.
    - Or at least I thought we were friends. We were supposed to meet around 6:12
      here.
    - "By the <benches>. We would always gather here around the benches and play
      but \u2026"
  - speaker: WILLIAM
    lines:
    - "But this place\u2026 it looks very empty\u2026 has it always been like this?  "
  - speaker: THE CHILD
    lines:
    - "You\u2019re right\u2026 This isn\u2019t the same place as I remember it to
      be. Oh! Maybe That\u2019s why my friends can\u2019t find me."
    - Do you think you could help me find them?
  - speaker: WILLIAM
    lines:
    - Uh sure. Do you want to describe what the place looked like? Maybe we could
      go look for it?
  - speaker: THE CHILD
    lines:
    - "The sketchbook! If you could draw them on a page, it\u2019d be easier for
      me to remember the look of that place."
  - speaker: WILLIAM
    lines:
    - "Sure, let\u2019s do it. How would you describe the positions?"
  - speaker: THE CHILD
    lines:
    - So there were four of the same bench. All <put around this circle and near
      the fountain>.
